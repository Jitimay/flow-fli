# FlowFli Demo Video Script (2:30)

## **[0:00-0:15] Hook & Problem**
*[Screen: Rural village, water statistics]*

**"2.2 billion people still lack access to clean water.**

**Not because pumps don't exist — but because payments, monitoring, and management systems fail.**

**So we built FlowFli: An autonomous AI water agent that runs itself."**

## **[0:15-0:45] Solution + Live Demo**
*[Screen: FlowFli dashboard, IQAI reasoning panel]*

**"FlowFli uses IQAI's ADK-TS framework to run an autonomous water system.**

**Now I'll purchase water for $50.**

**Watch this: FlowFli receives the payment → reasons through the rules → checks fraud → confirms the amount → and autonomously activates the pump for 60 minutes.**

**No human. No manual coding. The agent decides everything in real time."**

## **[0:45-1:15] Technical Power**
*[Screen: Code + agent graph + sensor readings]*

**"FlowFli is entirely agent-controlled. Built using IQAI's ADK-TS with OpenAI's GPT-3.5:**

**• Autonomous fraud detection**
**• Live sensor monitoring** 
**• Intelligent pump scheduling**
**• Decision logs for transparency**

**Here's a failed payment example: A $10 request is blocked. FlowFli explains why and refuses to activate the pump."**

## **[1:15-1:45] Real-World Impact**
*[Screen: Water level data, user events, pump activity]*

**"This isn't theoretical. FlowFli solves real problems for real communities:**

**• Reliable water access**
**• Fair pricing**
**• Sensor-based water protection**
**• Remote diagnostics**
**• Tamper-proof accountability**

**Every pump decision. Every transaction. Every water event — is logged and explainable."**

## **[1:45-2:10] ATP Integration**
*[Screen: ATP interface]*

**"FlowFli is ready for IQAI's Agent Tokenization Platform.**

**With ATP, FlowFli becomes:**
**• A tokenized on-chain agent**
**• Owned by the community**
**• Monetizable, scalable, and transparent**
**• Deployable without writing a smart contract**

**This is the future of decentralized public utilities."**

## **[2:10-2:30] Closing**
*[Screen: FlowFli logo + repo]*

**"FlowFli — where AI, IoT, and blockchain come together to deliver clean water autonomously.**

**Built for the IQAI Agent Arena. Built for impact."**
